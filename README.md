# machine-learning

A complete set of Machine learning projects &amp; algorithms. Hacktoberfest 2021
Machine learning is now one of the most required techniques in the field of analytics.

This repository is completely based on exploring the Machine learning algorithms and it’s real world applications which helps people to understand what actually we can do using machine learning algorithms.

To make the open source more meaningful. Let’s contribute to this repo.

The repo contains Algorithms and a project folder. Let’s explore these two.

**Algorithm**

There are many algorithms in Machine learning itself. But let’s start from the basics.

Contribute by writing machine learning algorithms from scratch in this folder.
You may use python or R or any programming language but make sure you won’t be using machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn, Tensorflow , pytorch.
You may use numpy, matplotlib, seaborn or pandas but make sure you do mathematical implementation from scratch.
**Some basic Algorithms ideas:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-nearest neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support vector machine
- Naive Bayes
- K-means clustering

You can add any other machine learning algorithms too.

**Project**

Try to do real world machine learning basic projects in this folder.
You may do it in a jupyter notebook for ease.
You can use any libraries like Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, pytorch.
  
**Some ideas:**
- Housing price prediction
- Diabetes prediction
- Heart disease prediction
- Breast cancer detection



**Contribution Rules**
- Don’t just commit by putting names to very generic stuff in your PR; provide reference hyperlinks so that others can get to know more about those stuff!
- Don’t spam with random PRs, otherwise we would have to mark them as invalid, hence forfeiting your participation in Hacktoberfest 2021 after two invalid PRs!
