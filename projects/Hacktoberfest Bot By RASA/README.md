# Few Words...

<b>Note: This is a demonstration to the much accepted and growing framework for Conversational AI, RASA.</b>

Easy to set things up, with great & powerful SOTA engine you can tweak as per your need, RASA Open-Source comes with large community of users & developers involved, making your learning-production-deployment even easier.
<br>
With an intention of introducing RASA to those folks of Nepali AI Community who seemed to have been less known to it, I have just initialized this basic bot for a demonstration with no advancements done in terms of its intelligence, one might find the bot pretty foolish. In that regard, I strongly urge you not to point towards its intelligence or project's progress, but understand its power and how versatile one could make this bot in such a less time and hassle given as compared to other chatbot frameworks.
<br><br>

## To Begin With...
- Install rasa with ``` pip3 install rasa ```
- Now If You Want To Run This Bot, Clone This Repo, Navigate To ```projects/Hacktoberfest Bot By RASA``` In Your Terminal. Now ``` rasa shell ``` Is All You Need To Begin From There.
- RASA also provides an interactive UI session you can run in your browser, giving you power to control and manage slots and intents passed. Hit the command ``` rasa x ``` right away!

- If You Want To Begin Building From Scratch, Initialize a basic pretrained rasa bot: ``` rasa init ```.


<b>Happy Hacktoberfest2021 to y'all! Let Your Machine Learn!</b>
